# Feature Optimization for Logistic Regression Models for Netflix Stock Price Prediction

This study investigates the predictive power of logistic regression models for forecasting Netflix stock price movements using both traditional financial indicators and content-related features. By incorporating data on the volume of high-rated titles added to Netflix's library, we extend beyond conventional stock prediction approaches. Our optimized logistic regression model achieves 96.4\% accuracy on test data, with balanced performance across both upward and downward price movements. Cross-validation across 500 iterations confirms the model's robustness, yielding a mean accuracy of 90.55\%. The strong correlation between high-rated content additions and stock performance highlights the value of integrating content quality metrics into financial prediction models. These findings demonstrate that relatively simple machine learning approaches, when paired with domain-specific features, can effectively predict stock price movements in the streaming entertainment sector.
