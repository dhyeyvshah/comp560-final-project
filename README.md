# Feature Engineering of Gaussian Naive Bayes Models for Netlix Stock Price Prediction

This project explores the application of Naïve Bayes models for predicting Netflix stock price movements. We focus on feature engineering to enhance predictive accuracy, currently using scikit-learn’s Gaussian Naïve Bayes with mini-batch gradient descent for training. The model achieves approximately 50% accuracy, a reasonable result given the many external factors influencing stock value. Netflix’s share price is closely tied to its subscription base, which depends on its content library and competition from platforms like Hulu, Peacock, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. To improve predictions, we incorporate external data on Netflix’s movie and TV catalog, including content quality, quantity, and brand perception. Ultimately, we will compare model performance with and without external company-related features to assess their impact on predictive accuracy.
